# Happily, Ever After Alone

 Once upon a time, there was a princess stuck in a castle waiting for her prince charming to come rescue her as she was told. However, with each passing day and dreadful nights, she started to lose hope until eventually, she took matters into her own hands and decided to escape. In her room, there was 2 doors that lead to different rooms...


## DOOR 1


With hesitation, she opened door 1 to be welcomed with snakes in a small dim room. "Snakes?! What should I do?”, she thought to herself, "I wonder if they're poisonous, they don't seem harmful". Little did she know that the snakes were cobras, one of the most poisonous snakes to ever exist and could kill her in seconds. As she was about to pass by them, something from above caught her eyes; it was a rope. She decided to climb the rope and swing above the snakes. 

With relieve, she landed safe on the other side of the room and was able to leave to the other room.


## DOOR 2

  The princess decided to go through door 2. To her surprise, the room was the king room with the heedin key. "That's strange," she side 
  Suddenly, a countdown timer appeared on the wall with only 1 min left and a 'hiss' can be heard through the walls. With panicking hands, she went straight to box on the ground 1.

 7, 6.... with shaking hands, she went with key 3 and inserted it to the lock ....5, 4.... "I won't make it", she thought as the timer went down and the king foot steps became laouder.

 With relieve, she was able to leave the castle.


 ## out side the castle


  While the princess was celebrating her success in escaping the castle, she didn't notice that she had another challenge to overcome. "For the love of god..." she said out loud with obvious frustration on her face. Turns out that the castle was surrounded by a rocky rood. "I rather full than stay stuck in this crappy castle," she thought.

  After 5 minutes she found two horses, she finally reached one of them and reach the other side safe and proved that when there is a will, there is always a way to solve your problems without waiting for others to help you. And she lived happily, ever after… alone.


  ## The end.
