  #                       Happily, Ever After Alone

Once upon a time, there was a princess stuck in a castle waiting for her prince
charming to come rescue her as she was told. However, with each passing day and
dreadful nights, she started to lose hope until eventually she took matters into her own
hands and decided to escape. In her room, there were 2 doors...

## Door 1:

With hesitation, she opened door 1 to be welcomed with snakes in a small dim room."Snakes?! What should I do?”, she thought to herself,"I wonder if they are poisonous,they don't seem harmful". Little did she know that the snakes were cobras, one of the most poisonous snakes to ever exist and could kill her in seconds. As she was about to pass by them, something caught her eyes; there was a weird looking brick that stood-out. After pressing it, a ladder showed above the snakes. With relief, she walked along it and landed safe on the other side of the room. However, the room led her back to the beginning and was left with no other choice... She had to pass through door 2. 



## Door 2:

The princess passed through door 2 to reach a colorful room. "That's strange," she thought, "I didn't know there was someone else beside me in this castle".
Suddenly, she heard foot steps from a far. The princess didn't know whether to stay still, or hide. But there is one thing for sure; the princess would not take any risks to wait and ask. She tried opening the door but it was locked. She started searching for the key. *Tap*...*tap*... as the foot steps got closer, her heart beat got faster. After finding the key behind a box, she opened the door with shaking hands and was able to leave the castle without being noticed by this stranger.



## Outside the castle:

The princess left the castle and was welcomed with 2 identical horses. After choosing a horse, she went straight into sunset while enjoying the free fresh air and leaving her past behind. Little did she know that the other horse was a trap; it was poisoned and would allert the stranger of the princess escaping.

After riding the horse for 30 minutes, she finally reached the other side safe and proved that when there is a will, there is always a way to solve your problems without waiting for others to help you. And she lived happily, ever after… alone.

The end (or not...).
